#### The Demo is at https://pang-lee.github.io/pang-lee.D3-USA_education_map.github.io/  
  
  The final project would be inside index.html  
  In script.js we get the public USA data from outside URL resource  
  And we use d3 library d3.json as our AJAX request toward the URL  
  After receving the data we need to change the data type from topoJson format to GeoJson format  
  It's more easy to draw data by using GeoJson format, but this is depend on personal choose  
  And we add the DOM event to display the education data while your mouse is hover on the specific state
